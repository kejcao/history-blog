China, with its rich history and cultural heritage as the longest continuous civilization in the world, has left behind a plethora of artifacts that point to its enduring legacy. Among these, three artifacts stand out for their immense scale and impact on both the people of their time and the future generations: the Terracotta Army, the Great Wall of China, and the Forbidden City. Each of these artifacts not only reveal details of ancient China to modern historians but also continue to influence contemporary society. Through their historical significance, lasting impact, and ongoing relevance, these artifacts embody the legacy of ancient China.

The Terracotta Army, discovered in 1974 in the Shaanxi province, is a huge underground collection of life-sized sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. This extraordinary archaeological find, accidentally uncovered by local farmers, dates back to approximately 210–209 BCE and includes over 8000 total soldiers, chariots, and horses, each meticulously crafted with unique features.¹ In addition, non-military figures are present such as officials, acrobats, and musicians. Each of the sculptures present could be considered their own artifact, but today we will consider the Terracotta Army as a collective whole.

The Terracotta Army holds great historical significance as it reflects the first emperor of China's power and resources. Construction began when the emperor was just 13 years old and over the next 38 years more than 700,000 labourers would contribute to the construction of this artifact.² The artifact's purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife and stands as the largest burial site on Earth. The life-sized scale and individually unique detail of the sculptures reveal to us the surprisingly advanced craftsmanship and organizational capabilities of the ancient Qin dynasty. Historians learn a lot about the Qin Dynasty, including its military organization, from the Terracotta Army.

The cause of the creation of the Terracotta Army was influenced by the belief in an afterlife and the desire to protect the emperor in it. Its consequences include the preservation of Qin Shi Huang's legacy and the reinforcement of imperial authority through this construction project. The discovery of the Terracotta Army has had consequences for historical scholarship and in particular have enriched the government through tourism revenue in China, attracting more than two million visitors a year.³ It has provided valuable insights into the military practices, artistry, and daily life of the Qin dynasty. Its enduring legacy continues to draw visitors from all over the globe to admire the sheer scale of this ancient burial complex.

The second artifact is the well-known Great Wall of China, consisting of numerous walls built over 2 millennia, primarily during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). It stretches over 13,000 miles and was constructed to protect the Chinese dynasty from invasions by nomadic tribes in its northern borders. The frontier walls constructed by various dynasties consist of multiple sections. Together, they extend from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, stretching from the current Sino-Russian border in the north to the Tao River (Taohe) in the south. They follow an arc that approximately outlines the edge of the Mongolian steppe. Today, the Great Wall's defensive system is widely acknowledged as one of history's most remarkable architectural and military achievements.⁴

The construction of the Great Wall was driven by multiple causes, primarily the need to defend against invasions by nomadic tribes from the north, such as the Mongols and Xiongnu. The decision to build the wall led to several significant consequences. It consolidated the emperor's power by demonstrating the state's capacity to mobilize vast resources and labor. In addition, the wall allowed the Chinese state to control a crucial point that allowed for the movement of people, goods, and trade across the Silk Road.⁵ Over time, the Great Wall has had "an incomparable symbolic significance in the history of China."⁶ It leaves a legacy as a symbol of protection and is an artifact of nation pride to the Chinese state. Its purpose was to not only protect China from those nomadic groups but also to preserve its unique culture from the customs of foreign barbarians.

The Great Wall of China is one of the most historically significant and recognizable structures in the world. Its sheer scale as one of the largest construction building projects ever undertaken (even in contemporary times) displays the ingenuity and resources at the disposal of ancient China. Built over two millennia and involving millions of workers, its construction spans dynasties and reflects the military concerns the northern groups posed at the time. Today, it is a significant part of China's cultural heritage and national pride. Given that the Great Wall of China was constructed over such a long time, spanning dynasties, it sheds light on the techniques and organizational methods employed across different historical periods and can give a hint at the economic, military, and labour conditions during a dynasty.

This artifact displays both continuity and change throughout history. Its primary purpose as a defensive system has remained consistent over the centuries, reflecting a continuous need for security and defense from the northern groups. However, its function and significance have evolved. Initially, it was simply a military fortification, but over time, it has changed to become a symbol of Chinese strength and perseverance. In contemporary times, it serves as a major tourist attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage site, reflecting a shift from its purpose as a defensive structure to a cultural and historical monument.

The third artifact is the Forbidden City, built during the Ming dynasty and serving as the imperial palace for the Emperor of China for over 500 years. This vast, historically significant complex in Beijing was the political and heart of Chinese governance, reflecting the flamboyant grandeur and authority of its inhabitant emperors. It claims to consist of 9,999 rooms and symbolizes Emperor's centralized power through its sprawling scale. The architecture incorporates subtle Confucian principles.⁷ Despite the fall of the Qing dynasty and the transition of China into a republic, the Forbidden City's significance has evolved from a seat of power to a cultural heritage site. Today, as a UNESCO World Heritage site and a major tourist attraction, it continues to offer insights into China's historical, social, and cultural dynamics, representing its enduring legacy and importance.

The decision to build such a grandiose complex had several consequences. It centralized the administrative functions of the empire.⁸ Such an imposing structure reinforces the authority and control of the emperor. The architectural design, adhering to Confucian principles, aimed to manifest cosmic order and harmony, thus legitimizing the emperor's rule. The Forbidden City's construction also had economic and social implications, requiring vast resources and labor, which again shows the state's organizational capabilities.

Examining the Forbidden City from various historical perspectives and identifying the multifaceted purposes it serves helps to improve our understanding of its legacy. Socially, it reveals the hierarchical nature of Chinese society, where access to the city was restricted based on rank and privilege, emphasizing the emperor's supreme status as opposed to the common people. Culturally, the Forbidden City is a masterpiece of Chinese architecture, reflecting the aesthetic principles and craftsmanship achievements of its time. Politically, the Forbidden city was where the centralized power of the Chinese emperors rest. Intellectually, the architecture is derived from many Confucian ideals, showcasing how these philosophical principles were translated into architectural form. By considering the Forbidden City through these different perspectives, we gain a better understanding and deeper appreciation for this artifact.

The Great Wall of China, the Terracotta Army, and the Forbidden City collectively embody the enduring legacy of ancient China, showing us its artistry, resources, and capabilities. These monumental artifacts share a common thread in their reflection of the power and authority of the Chinese emperors, the required mobilization of vast resources and labor, and their role in reinforcing the existing status-quo. Each structure served to protect and legitimize the emperor's rule—whether literally through the Great Wall's defensive system, the Terracotta Army's spiritual guardianship, or the vast Forbidden City's designed as the seat of the Emperor's power. Today, they continue to amaze and educate us about China, offering us an avenue to explore the political, social, and cultural aspects of society at their time. As the most famous artifacts in China, these collectively show us the lasting impact of ancient China to history and even our present day.
