The ancient civilization of China has a rich history, with numerous artifacts and relics that reveal to us this foundational period of Chinese civilization. During this period, core aspects of Chinese culture, philosophy, and technology were being developed. When considering the most historically significant artifacts in shaping the creation and development of ancient China, three items stand out to me.

The Yijing or "Book of Changes" is an ancient Chinese divination text that is one of the oldest of the Chinese classics. Originating from around 1000 BCE, the Yijing is about change and the interplay between yin and yang. It is historically significant as it has strongly influenced ancient Chinese cosmology and philosophy, and is considered one of the Five Classics. The ideas contained within the Yijing contributed to the worldview and Confucius value system of ancient Chinese civilization.

Another influential artifact is the imposing Terracotta Army, the famous collection of life-sized sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China. Discovered in 1974, this massive underground necropolis features thousands of detailed warrior, horse, and chariot figures. The Terracotta Army is a historically significant artifact because it shows us not only the scale of Qin Shi Huang's ambition to advance imperial power, while also indicating the technical artistry and craftsmanship of ancient Chinese society.

Finally, the Chu Silk Manuscript is an ancient Chinese silk text dating back to around 300 BCE. As one of the earliest examples of Chinese writing on silk, it is historically significant, as the manuscript gives us a peek of the social, political, and philosophical life during the Warring States period. It covers various topics such as astronomy, rituals, divination, and the Warring States political climate.

In conclusion, the Yijing, Terracotta Army, and Chu Silk Manuscript are the most historically significant artifacts in the creation of the ancient civilization of China. They show to historians the cultural and technological sophistication that were present in ancient Chinese civilization.
